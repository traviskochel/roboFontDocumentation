A short list of changes:

A total new code editor with lots of color and theming support. Completely new syntax highlighter. The same editor can be used to highlight feature code or .glif xml files.

Changing numbers by selecting them and dragging them down with cmd.
When the selection contains a coordinate 100, 100; the x, y drag is added to those values.

Short Keys

RoboFont allows to set any kind of short key for a script and extensions as long as the key combination does not exist yet.

Inspector

Have a look at the :ref:`versionHistory` for the full list of changes and additions.

You should get an automatic update when you use RoboFont 1.3.
If you still use RoboFont 1.1 you should :ref:`redownload <download>` the app.

I would like to thank all the beta testers and all users posting on the `forums <http://forum.robofont.com/>`_ for their precious feedback and feature requests.

enjoy!
