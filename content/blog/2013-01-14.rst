Some highlights:

*   Smart Set Binders, aka organizing Smart Sets in "folders"
*   Undo for guides, both local as global guides
*   Optimized RTL support in Space Center and Kern Center
*   Support for boolean operations on glyph objects:

    ::

        result = glyph1 | glyph2 (union)
        result = glyph1 % glyph2 (difference)
        result = glyph1 & glyph2 (intersection)
        result = glyph1 ^ glyph2 (xor)

Have a look at the :ref:`versionHistory` for the full list of changes and additions.

You should get an automatic update when you use RoboFont 1.3.
If you still use RoboFont 1.1 you should :ref:`redownload <download>` the app.

I would like to thank all the beta testers and all users posting on the `forums <http://forum.robofont.com/>`_ for their precious feedback and feature requests.

enjoy!
