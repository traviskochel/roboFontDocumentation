Read the :ref:`versionHistory`, a complete list of changes, add ons  and new features.

You should get an atomically update when you use RoboFont 1.2.
If you still use RoboFont 1.1 you should :ref:`redownload <download>` the app.

I would like to thank all the beta testers and all users posting on the `forums <http://forum.robofont.com/>`_ for their precious feedback and feature requests.

Enjoy and draw good type!

The documentation will get incremental updates.
