Welcome to RoboFont
===================

RoboFont is a UFO-based font editor for Mac OS X.

RoboFont provides a simple-to-use environment to draw and modify typefaces in. It has the following main design features:

* Is written from scratch in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ with scalability in mind.
* Has full scripting access to objects and the application interface.
* Can be used as a platform to build additional tools on.
* Does not preform any 'auto-magic'.
* Does not overload the user with a multitude of options.
* Uses the UFO format as it's native file format.

The operating philosophy behind RoboFont is:

**The tools you choose influence your creative process.**

Because of this, RoboFont provides many opportunities for the user to tailor the application to their design process. It is strict about not preforming 'auto-magic' on one's font files, 'auto-' anything is avoided if possible. This means that it does not do and does not have some features of other font editing applications. Because the application is extensible, if a user finds a need in their design process for a feature that isn't part of RoboFont, it can be added. This allows the user the control to design the application to their design process.

However, the core of RoboFont is a full featured drawing editor, containing all the basic tools a typeface designer needs for drawing and modifying a design.
