RoboFont can install a font directly in the OS. This font will be directly available for use in any other application. The font will be installed only for the current user and will be deactivated when the UFO document in RoboFont is closed, when the user quits RoboFont or when the user logs out.

Test install will always generate a *.otf*. There are some setting you can alter in the Preferences like decompose, auto hint and remove overlap.

Test install can be found in the :ref:`applicationMenu`.
