Group Editor
============

The group editor makes it possible to create groups of glyphs.

Groups can be used for several purposes: spacing, kerning, and organizing character sets. Groups, unlike some other font editors, are not used in the OpenType features window.

Groups can be created by clicking on the + button at the bottom left of the window. The name of each group can be changed with a double-click.

To add glyphs to a group, simply drag them from the collection at the bottom of the window to the group contents area at the upper right.

The glyphs contained in each group can be visualized as normal glyph cells, or can be stacked on top of each other for easier comparison of the letter shapes. This feature is specially useful when creating spacing and kerning classes.
